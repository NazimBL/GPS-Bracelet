Difference between Serial.print/prinln & Serial.write:
-Serial.write send a byte value while Serial.print sends ASCII-human readable (strings) values
 better use in display(lcds and shit) or storage (sd card).
==> Serial.write uses less size
-Serial.println() sends \r \n at the end of the argument
*Conclusion :Serial.write() is definetely more suitable in our communication protocal
